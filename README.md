# StudentGenetic
A program that finds the best student using genetic algorithms and simulation of student's life. 

## Genetic algorithms
Each student is ranked by knowledge and rating. Best half of students is mixed together using genetics algorithms and the second half is regenerated randomly. Genetic algorithms are based on this article from [MFF CUNI](http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~pepca/prg022/luner.html).

## Simulation
Each student has its own specific genes which specify his character and habits. Simulation is proceeded day by day, on the end of the semester the examination is performed. After the end of a generation, the genetic algorithms are used for generating new generation.
